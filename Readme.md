# Solar system
This is a simulation of the solar system in Javascript. It is considered as a many body system using central difference scheme for the integration. The animation is done using **requestAnimationFrame** which requires a translation between simulation time and real time. The **scale** in the conversion function **p2m** is chosen such that the solar system fits into the viewport for a usual screen resolution. Adjust that scale to obtain different planet sizes and distances between them.
